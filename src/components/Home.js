    <h1>The Agua Dulce Women's Club</h1>
    <p>The Agua Dulce Women's Club, organized September 23, 1948, is a non-profit organization providing the only community owned building in town, and offers a historic meeting place for community organizations and public and private events. With the planned renovations, it will also serve as the casualty collection center for the Agua Dulce Disaster Preparedness Coalition providing food and shelter for the 1700+ homes in a rural community that may become isolated from emergency services in the event of fire or other natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Agua Dulce Womenâ€™s Club also hosts recreational and educational opportunities for the benefit of the community, placing special emphasis on activities, scholarships and support for the children of Agua Dulce.</p>
<p>The Clubhouse is located at 33201 Agua Dulce Canyon Road, Agua Dulce, CA 91390.</p>
